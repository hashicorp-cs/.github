HashiCorp Customer Success

This organization houses repositories relevant to HashiCorp customer success.  This includes everyone, but is expected to be mostly written to by the SEA organization with demo and example repositories meant for public consumption as part of our work to ease adoption for all our customers.

## How do I make a repository public?

In order to make a repository public, you'll need to follow some HashiCorp [standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUmuAGNDULSbVe2MJOXm9guCHGdYQ2wlpt3XL8-EPz0/edit) around licensing, `README` and code quality.

- The repository must have a disclaimer following the [HashiCorp standard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1enFs2TNiVi5Sg9FRZ42z8aYo6KjfYP9Ptt1-5DUr6cs/edit?usp=sharing).
- The repository must have a license. The standard for HashiCorp products is the [MPL-2.0 License](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).
- The repository must have a `README.md` that follows our [standard](https://github.com/hashicorp-sa/template-generic/blob/main/README.md).
- The code in the repository must be clean, this means:
  - Free of any customer specific references.
  - Tidy and easy to read. Variable and method names should be descriptive and concise.
  - Formatted/linted to the standard of the language in use.
- The repository must have a branch protection policy on the `main` branch. This should have been set by default when you first created the repository, but please check it has not been disabled.

Once the repository meets these standards you can follow this process to make it public:
